Feature: StrategyInterface Protocol Compliance
  As a trading system architect
  I want to verify that strategy implementations follow the StrategyInterface protocol
  So that strategies can be used interchangeably with consistent behavior

  @strategy @interface @compliance
  Scenario: Strategy interface compliance verification
    Given I have a mock strategy implementation
    When I inspect the strategy interface compliance
    Then the strategy should have all required attributes
    And the strategy should have all required methods
    And all method signatures should match the protocol

  @strategy @dependency_injection
  Scenario: Strategy dependency injection compliance
    Given I have a mock strategy implementation
    And I have mock dependencies for testing
    When I inject dependencies into the strategy
    Then the strategy should accept MoneyManager injection
    And the strategy should accept DataManager injection
    And the dependency injection should not cause errors

  @strategy @components @management
  Scenario: Strategy component management
    Given I have a mock strategy implementation
    And I have mock components for testing
    When I add components to the strategy
    Then the strategy should accept signal components
    And the strategy should accept optimizer components
    And the strategy should accept predictor components
    And the strategy should accept runner components
    And the strategy should accept metric components
    And the strategy should accept verificator components
    And component addition should not cause errors

  @strategy @lifecycle @execution
  Scenario: Strategy execution lifecycle compliance
    Given I have a mock strategy implementation
    And the strategy has mock dependencies injected
    And the strategy has mock components added
    When I execute the strategy lifecycle methods
    Then the strategy initialize method should be callable
    And the strategy generate_signals method should be callable
    And the strategy execute_trades method should be callable
    And the strategy run_backtest method should be callable
    And all lifecycle methods should return mock results

    @strategy @return_types
  Scenario: Strategy method return type validation
    Given I have a mock strategy implementation
    And the strategy has mock dependencies and components configured
    When I call strategy methods with valid inputs
    Then the initialize method should return boolean type
    And the generate_signals method should return correct signal type
    And the execute_trades method should return dict type
    And the run_backtest method should return dict type
    And return types should match the protocol specifications

  @strategy @parameter_validation
  Scenario: Strategy parameter type validation
    Given I have a mock strategy implementation
    And I have test parameters of various types
    When I call strategy methods with valid parameter types
    Then the methods should accept the parameters without type errors
    When I call strategy methods with invalid parameter types
    Then the methods should reject invalid parameters appropriately
    And proper parameter validation should occur

  @strategy @exception_handling
  Scenario: Strategy exception handling contracts
    Given I have a mock strategy implementation
    When I call methods on uninitialized strategy
    Then proper exceptions should be raised for invalid states
    When I call methods with missing dependencies
    Then proper exceptions should be raised for missing dependencies
    When I call methods with invalid inputs
    Then proper exceptions should be raised for invalid inputs
    And all exceptions should be informative and appropriate

  @strategy @state_management
  Scenario: Strategy state management validation
    Given I have a mock strategy implementation
    When I inject dependencies into the strategy
    Then the strategy should maintain proper internal state
    And dependency references should be correctly stored
    When I add components to the strategy
    Then the strategy should maintain proper component state
    And component references should be correctly stored
    And the strategy state should remain consistent throughout
