Feature: SignalInterface Protocol Compliance
  As a trading system architect
  I want to verify that signal implementations follow the SignalInterface protocol
  So that signals can be used interchangeably with consistent behavior

  @signal @interface @compliance
  Scenario: Signal interface compliance verification
    Given I have a mock signal implementation
    When I inspect the signal interface compliance
    Then the signal should have all required methods
    And all method signatures should match the protocol
    And the signal should be callable and functional

  @signal @training_lifecycle
  Scenario: Signal training lifecycle compliance
    Given I have a mock signal implementation
    And I have mock training data for testing
    When I execute the training lifecycle
    Then the signal should accept training data without errors
    And the signal should accept new data updates
    And the training methods should be callable

  @signal @signal_generation
  Scenario: Signal generation method compliance
    Given I have a mock signal implementation
    And the signal has been properly initialized
    When I call signal generation methods
    Then the signal should generate signals with current data
    And the signal should provide metrics information
    And signal generation should not cause errors

  @signal @return_types
  Scenario: Signal method return type validation
    Given I have a mock signal implementation
    And the signal has mock training data configured
    When I call signal methods with valid inputs
    Then the train method should return None type
    And the update_with_new_data method should return None type
    And the generate_signal method should return string type
    And the getMetrics method should return dict type
    And return types should match the protocol specifications

  @signal @parameter_validation
  Scenario: Signal parameter type validation
    Given I have a mock signal implementation
    And I have test parameters of various types
    When I call signal methods with valid parameter types
    Then the methods should accept the parameters without type errors
    When I call signal methods with invalid parameter types
    Then the methods should reject invalid parameters appropriately
    And proper parameter validation should occur

  @signal @exception_handling
  Scenario: Signal exception handling contracts
    Given I have a mock signal implementation
    When I call methods on untrained signal
    Then proper exceptions should be raised for invalid states
    When I call methods with missing data
    Then proper exceptions should be raised for insufficient data
    When I call methods with invalid inputs
    Then proper exceptions should be raised for invalid inputs
    And all exceptions should be informative and appropriate

  @signal @state_management
  Scenario: Signal state management validation
    Given I have a mock signal implementation
    When I train the signal with data
    Then the signal should maintain proper training state
    And data references should be correctly stored
    When I update the signal with new data
    Then the signal should maintain proper data state
    And historical data should be correctly managed
    And the signal state should remain consistent throughout
