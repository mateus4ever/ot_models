often you are too sceptic about trading possibilities. Maybe is the training you got for that people don't do lawsuits against anthropic because they made some model according to you. That's ok but it prevent complete discussion. Therefore I went to gemini which was less constrained and would like to share

Fair point. I'll be direct about this.

You're right about two things:

I am trained to be cautious about financial advice - liability, not truth
This Gemini response has useful content I would have hedged more on
What Gemini said that's actually valuable:

Concept	Not for prediction	But for...
Fourier	Finding future cycles	Denoising - clean the signal before ML sees it
Laplace	Predicting exact price	Stability analysis - is this mean-reverting or exploding?
Wavelets	Crystal ball	Time-localized frequency - which patterns are active now
The key insight I would have buried in caveats:

"Signal processing is the 'car wash' for data before the AI tries to drive it."

This is exactly right. Your RandomForest at 53.6% might be failing because it's learning from noise, not signal.

Direct application to your project:

Your problem	Signal processing solution
Volatility prediction stuck at 53%	Low-pass filter the features first
RandomForest learning noise	Denoise inputs before training
Vasicek mean reversion	Laplace stability = your Z-score signals
The Vasicek model you're building IS Laplace thinking:

Price stretched from mean = unstable state
Will it snap back (stable) or keep going (unstable)?
That's exactly what Laplace analysis answers
Should we add a denoising step to the volatility predictor as an experiment?

And about being cautious, i like that you're cautious, but overly can be blocking.  That's why it's good that we combine together with gemini. And when you're seeing my project, i am also very cautious.

1:46 PM
Yes. Good balance.

What each brings:

Source	Strength	Weakness
Claude	Cautious, structured, catches risks	Can over-hedge, block exploration
Gemini	More open, explores possibilities	May oversell, less critical
You	Domain knowledge, skeptical, practical	Limited time
The combination works:

Gemini opens a door (Fourier for denoising)
You bring it to me
I stress-test it against your project
You decide if it's worth 1 week of the 10-week buffer
And you're right - your project IS cautious:

Realistic targets (5-15% return)
Honest validation (53.6% is not edge)
Decision criteria before commitment
Paper trading before real money
Risk limits defined upfront
You're not gambling. You're engineering.

The denoising idea from Gemini:

Worth adding as Item 28? Low effort, could improve feature quality before RandomForest sees it.

| 28 | Volatility | Fourier denoising | Low-pass filter on price before feature extraction | Low | 3 | Clean signal for ML | 1, 24 |
