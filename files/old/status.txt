After one hour still doing sthing. We need to improve1:30 PMIdentified optimization strategies to accelerate prolonged test execution.The user says the tests are taking over an hour, which is way too long. The Scenario Outline with 4 examples means 4 full validation runs × ~8 minutes each = ~32 minutes expected. But it's taking over an hour.
Let me think about what could be optimized:

Reduce chunk size or training window - but this affects validation quality
Reduce number of examples - just test baseline vs all_features (2 instead of 4)
Use smaller dataset - but this affects validation quality
Cache the data loading - data is loaded fresh for each scenario
Parallelize - run scenarios in parallel

The quickest wins:

Reduce examples to 2: baseline vs all_features (skip intermediate configs)
Reduce validation size: smaller training window or fewer chunks
Data caching: load data once, reuse across scenarios

Let me suggest practical options.One hour is too long. Options:

Option 1: Reduce examples (fastest fix)
gherkin  Examples:
    | config_name      | time_features | efficiency_ratio |
    | baseline         | disabled      | disabled         |
    | all_features     | enabled       | enabled          |
2 runs instead of 4. ~16 min total.

Option 2: Smaller validation window
gherkinWhen I run chunked validation with 5000 training window and 2500 per chunk
Faster but less robust.

Option 3: Separate tag for quick comparison
